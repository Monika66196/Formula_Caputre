# ✨ Floating Formula Capture

> *Snip → Extract → Edit → Copy LaTeX — in seconds.*

**Floating Formula Capture** is a simple, lightweight tool designed to sit quietly on your desktop — always ready when you need it. Just snip a region of your screen, and it instantly extracts the math formula and gives you the LaTeX. That’s it. Fast, no-fuss, and made for the real work we do as students, educators, and researchers.

## 🚀 What It Does

- 🪟 **Floating Popup:** Always-on-top, distraction-free mini window that works over any app — PDFs, slides, videos, even Zoom screens!
- ✂️ **Snip Anywhere:** Select any region from your screen like a snipping tool — ideal for handwritten notes, printed pages, screenshots, or presentation slides.
- 🧠 **Smart Formula Recognition:** Sends the image to the **Mathpix OCR API** (or a pluggable open-source engine, if you prefer), and converts it into clean LaTeX.
- ✍️ **Editable Output:** Edit or tweak the LaTeX before you use it. No need to start over if it got one tiny thing wrong.
- 📋 **One-Click Copy:** Just hit copy and paste the LaTeX into your document, Overleaf, or wherever you need it.

## 🎯 Why I Made This

As a researcher constantly juggling between lecture slides, PDFs, and scribbled notes, I needed a tool that worked like muscle memory — snip, grab the math, paste. No clutter, no waiting. So I built this — and I hope it helps you too.
